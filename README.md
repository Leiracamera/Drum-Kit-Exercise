This is a project I worked on as part of the App Brewery Complete Web Development Bootcamp. 

The skeleton HTML and CSS was pre-written and I wrote the JS script alongside the course tutorials. 

The aim of the project was to learn more about using keyboard event Listeners, understanding callbacks and how to respond to events, and using classList.add and classList.remove.
